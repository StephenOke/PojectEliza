# PojectEliza
this is i code i wrote. it is a self question asking program that uses the information input by the user to ask the user another question to keep the conversation going, there are several questions prompts in the code to keep asking different questions. Eliza will start by asking you of your name then it will ask how you are feeling, then from your input, it will ask other questions and all you have to do is keep answering! 

fun fact - if you use a an exclamation point in your input, it will tell you to stop yelling
